    <p>I made these coconut chocolate Rice Krispies Treats to change up the normal every day recipe a little bit one day when my 6 year old son and I were looking through the kitchen to see what we could add.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package large marshmallows</li>
        <li>5 cups chocolate flavored crispy rice cereal</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sweetened flaked coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Melt butter in large sauce pan over medium-low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until melted and smooth. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Quickly stir the marshmallow mixture into the cereal and coconut to coat. Press into the prepared pan with the back of a buttered spoon. Cool completely before cutting into squares.</li>
    </ol>
